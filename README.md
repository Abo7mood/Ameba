## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

This game was developed for one of my clients who wanted to **remake a game he originally created in 1997**. As a freelancer, I was tasked with modernizing it while maintaining the **classic feel** of the original.

The challenge was to stay **true to the original mechanics** while introducing **better physics, animations, and smoother controls**. This project was a great opportunity to **merge old-school nostalgia with modern gaming elements**.

It remains one of my **most enjoyable freelance projects**, blending **retro design principles** with contemporary game development techniques.
